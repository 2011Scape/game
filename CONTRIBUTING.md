# Contribution Guidelines

## Welcome to the 2011 RuneScape Emulation Project!

We're excited to have you here. This document provides a set of guidelines to ensure smooth collaboration and maintain the project's quality. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with these guidelines before contributing.

### 1. **Getting Started**

- **Fork the Repository**: Begin by forking the main repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to work on your own version of the project, without affecting the primary codebase.
  
- **Clone Your Fork**: Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine to begin development.

### 2. **Work on a New Branch**

- Always create a new branch for your changes. Naming your branch descriptively can help others understand the work you're doing. Example: `add-prayer-system` or `fix-login-bug`.

### 3. **Keep Your Fork Synced**

- Regularly pull from the main repository to keep your fork up-to-date. This helps avoid merge conflicts.

### 4. **Committing Your Changes**

- Write clear and concise commit messages describing the changes you've made.
  
- Commit often, but ensure each commit is meaningful.

### 5. **Coding Standards**

- Follow established coding conventions already in the project. Consistency is key!
  
- Comment your code. Especially when introducing new features or systems, comments can help other contributors understand your thought process.
  
- Prioritize code readability. The next contributor who reads your code will thank you!

### 6. **Submitting a Pull Request (PR)**

- Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
  
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub.
  
- From your fork, open a new pull request to the main repository.
  
- Clearly describe the purpose of the PR, the changes you made, and any other relevant details.

### 7. **Review & Feedback**

- Once a PR is submitted, other contributors may review your code and request changes. This process ensures the quality of code and maintains the project's direction.
  
- Be open to feedback. Constructive criticism helps us all grow and the project to thrive.

### 8. **Testing**

- Before submitting a PR, ensure your changes do not introduce new bugs. Test thoroughly!
  
- If possible, write unit tests for the functionality you've added or modified.

### 9. **Community Interaction**

- Always be respectful and kind. Remember that this project is a collaborative effort. We're all here because we love the game and want to see this emulation succeed.
  
- If unsure about a change or direction, don't hesitate to open an issue or discuss on existing issues.

### 10. **Stay Updated**

- Regularly check the project's milestones and issues to stay updated on current priorities and directions.
